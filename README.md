# Snake Game Web App 💻 🐍

## This is a user-oriented website intended to host a replication of the popular everlasting snake game. You can play for fun and to test your skills while going down the memory lane, but if competition is your forte, create a new account by registaring to make sure yor score is save and compete for the place in the leaderboards!

### This is a website I built as a final project for my it202 (internet aplications) class. This is an app that works with both frontend and banckend implementations. Client side is handle by JavaScript and JQuery through AJAX and the backend is handle by PHP and MySQL for data storage.
